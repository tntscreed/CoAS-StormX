}
Strength {
 (Power) Strength - Needed to hit hard, throw far, and carry a lot. Influences Weight points (carrying ability) and Life points. The defining characteristic for skills that take lots of physical exertion, especially heavy and medium weapons, and general weapon skills. 
}
Perception {
 (Insight) Perception - The talent for clear sight and hearing. Without a good eye, the cannonballs will hardly fly in the enemy's direction. Particularly influences the skills Accuracy and Stealth. 
}
Agility {
 (Reaction) Agility - Hand-eye coordination. An awkward man would get his sword stuck in its scabbard, and the boarding hook would get stuck on the pants of its owner. Required for such skills as Light Weapons, Medium Weapons, Pistols and Boarding. Affects maximum amount of energy. 
}
Charisma {
 (Authority) Charisma - The sum of a manly, wounded physiognomy and a nicely balanced tongue. A leader doesn't have to turn to force to gain the goods of successful trader - he'll give them himself. The best people will follow him, and the most beautiful women will wait for him at every port. Leadership is a required attribute for such skills as Authority and Trade. Affects the number of joining officers. 
}
Intellect {
 (Talent) Intellect - Knowledge, wisdom, and the ability to make quick decisions. A smart character won't have trouble quickly reloading a weapon or dropping prices at a store. Using navigational items also requires smarts. Affects the skills Trade, Cannons, Navigation, and - especially - the rapidity with which a man raises in Rank and learns new Personal Abilities and Ship Abilities. 
}
Endurance {
 (Endurance) Constitution - Really needed for a hero to survive the difficult pirate profession. And it is needed no less by potential clients. Repair and Defense are most affected by this Capability, as is Life point gain and Weight. 
}
Luck {
 (Success) Luck - What can we say about luck? If there's luck, we're gentlemen. If not, we'll come to naught. Helps where nothing else will. A bullet will pass you by, and an enemy will walk past without noticing you. Affects the skills Pistols, Luck, and Stealth. 
}
FencingLight {
 Ability to use light weapons - mostly rapiers and small-sized murder weapons. Depends on Reaction and Insight. (R*0.9+I*0.1) 
}
Fencing {
 Ability to use sabers - weapons that take not just strength, but a certain skill. Depends on Power and Reaction. (P*0.6+R*0.4) 
}
FencingHeavy {
 Use of heavy broadswords, axes and swords requires quite a lot of physical strength. Depends on Power and Endurance. (P*0.9+E*0.1) 
}
Pistol {
 The skill to use high-technology devices, that can send small leaden balls over a big distance. Demands deftness and a certain luck. Who knows where that bullet will fly... Depends on Reaction and Success.(R*0.5+S*0.5) 
}
Fortune {
 Luck - basically having good fortune. Needed everywhere. Depends on Success. (S) 
}
Leadership {
 Leadership. When every person sees that with you they won't go down in any conflict, they start to believe in you, and the taverns start to fill with those that want to join your marches. Enemy ships start to surrender when they just see your flag. And if your authority is high, your men will board the sea devil himself. Depends on Authority and Talent. (A*0.9+T*0.1) 
}
Commerce {
 Trade. The skill of making a killing off something you bought for a pittance the day before. You need to know the juicy trade routes, to have an informed grasp on the market, and to hold good relations with storeowners. All of that fills the pockets with pleasant weight, and frees a man from such trifling concerns as paying his team or a lack of canvas in the stores. Needs Talent, and the confident Authority of a leader. (T*0.8+A*0.2) 
}
Accuracy {
 Accuracy. One of the most essential qualities for a wanderer of the boundless sea. A real captain won't waste powder and munitions on all the fish in the neighborhood. Every volley must be straight and to the point! And when the salt air clears the fog of war, the horizon must be clear of any debris! You're useless without good Insight and a certain degree of Success. (I*0.8+S*0.2) 
}
Cannons {
 Cannons. Quick, now! Ready and position your arms - then before your ears even stop ringing, clean again, pack again, and aim. Don't forget to douse 'em in water, lest they overheat... There's no time for distraction, amongst the thunder and flame of mortal battle. Just load up, roll up, and volley! Requires Talent and Power. (T*0.6+P*0.4) 
}
Sailing {
 Navigation. The ability to bring a ship to port, through storm or mist. The skill to read navigational tools and command squadrons. In the hands of a skillful skipper, even the biggest and most terrifying ship will fly like a bird. Depends on Insight and Talent. (I*0.2+T*0.8) 
 A lack of navigational skill leads to penalties in all skills and characteristics of the hero. 
 class 1 requires 95 
 class 2 requires 80 
 class 3 requires 65 
 class 4 requires 40 
 class 5 requires 25 
 class 6 requires 1 
 The difference between the current and required level navigational skill will be deducted from the class of ship. 
}
Repair {
 Repair. When the enemy is crashing a hail of shells on your ship, turning the deck to sawdust and the sails to rags; when the downpour the hull cracks, and the wind rips the links apart like threads - this is when repair becomes the most important skill. The most important thing here is Endurance, but you can't do much without Insight either. (E*0.8+I*0.2) 
}
Grappling {
 Grappling. To position the ship accurately across from the enemy deck, to throw an accurate catwalk on your first try, then to ram the trembling enemy, sweep through the decks like a hurricane and take the enemy ship for your much deserved prize - this all takes quite the knack and experience. Still, the richness of the reward makes up for all the effort. Requires Reaction and Talent. (R*0.7+T*0.3) 
}
Defence {
 Defense. As the days roll by, the crew bonds with its ship, until each hardened sailor is worth ten greenhorns from the tavern. A good captain, therefore, takes pains to protect his men from stupid and pointless death in battle. Endurance and good Authority are equally important in mobilizing the crew to defend the ship. (E*0.5+A*0.5) 
}
Sneak {
 Stealth. To slink pass an enemy structure, hide from pursuers in the wide open ocean, or set on a clueless enemy like thunder from the clear sky, this is a skill no adventurer can go without. Impossible without exceptional Success and Insight. (S*0.5+I*0.5) 
}
Loyality {
 An officer's loyalty is determined by your actions. Officers with a good reputation won't work long for a scoundrel, while villains won't have much patience for a honest life. 
}
Ship_abilities {
 Abilities that affect the effectiveness of controlling a ship. 
 The number shows how many skills have yet to be assigned. 
}
Personal_abilities {
 Abilities that expand a character's abilities. 
 The number shows how many skills have yet to be assigned. 
}
Rank {
 Rank - the level of a character's in-game development. As skill increases, so the rank raises in level. As rank goes up, so too does the character's life (depending on Endurance). 
 With a rise in rank, the hero will attract stronger enemies and more sophisticated items. 
}
Life {
 Life - the character's hardiness, as concerns physical damage. The bigger the character's life, then the more injury he must take to give it up. 
 Every increase in rank extends the length of his life, dependent on his Endurance. 
 }
Health {
 Health - the general physical condition of the hero. The worse his health, the more reduced his Abilities. Health worsens with further wounds, and recovers more quickly if the hero can avoid hand-to-hand combat. 
}
Energy {
 Energy - the character's steadiness in a hand-to-hand fight. All attacking motions cost a certain amount of energy. If a character should tire in the course of battle, he will need a breather to recover his strength. 
 A hero's energy limit depends on his level of Reaction. 
}
Money {
Money - everybody loves money; that's why they call it money! Doubloons, piasters, talers, guineas... What's the difference? It's all gold! 
}
Reputation {
 Reputation - an indicator of how others may treat you. Reputation can be high (positive), neutral, or low (negative). You earn repute through your actions, which will affect how others interpret your further actions throughout the game.  
 A hero's renown fades over time, and actions disappear from memory. The bad is remembered better, while the good is forgotten. If you just sit idle, then in time your reputation will slide back to "regular sailor". 
}
weight {
 Weight - the maximum weight that a character can lug around before he starts to lose mobility. 
 Depends on Power and Endurance. 
 }
Title {
Title - an Honorary Title that serves as an indicator of how much good the character has brought to the empire he serves.
}
NextExp {
 The experience threshold shows your current Rank, accumulation of Abilities, the skill points you have earned, and how many points remain before your next level. You earn skill points through your actions. For example, every accurate pistol shot racks up points for your firearms skill. In turn, these points are funneled into your overall Rank experience and Personal Abilities or Ship Abilities (depending on the skills and their linked Abilities). Crossing the threshold of a rank or skill moves you up to the next level, thereby raising your life and skill points, which you may dole out at will.}
TABLE_PERKS {Hero's abilities}
TABLE_PERKS_desc {
 You may add to your Abilities if there are points in Personal Abilities or Ship Abilities. 
 Double-click on the chosen ability, to spend a free point on it. 
 Due to some interdependencies, some abilities cannot be initially chosen. At the start, you need to pick the most basic Abilities. From there, more advanced Abilities will become available to you. 
}
PERK_TABLE_NEED {Skill Requirements}
PERK_TABLE_NEED_desc {
 To choose the selected skill, the hero needs all the following proficiencies. 
}
Nation_hint {
 Hero's nation - the nation you chose at the game's start, or otherwise the nation of your current patent. You can see it in the "Character" menu. On the "Nation" menu, you can see your ship's current flag, which can be changed at sea to hide your true identity. But enemies of the empire might be spotted at sea, or by the guards at port. The hero's stealth affects the success of the ruse. If the hero has a price on his head from his chosen nation, then he is considered its enemy as well. 
 Any enemy detection keeps in mind the relationship between countries and the number of bounties in the player's name. 
 Quick pass doesn't work in enemy cities. 
}
England_descr {
 England. If anyone may squeeze Spain out of the New World, it will be England. While back in the Old World, France actively engages Escorial with yet another war for the Spanish throne, England is methodically taking over one Spanish colony after another, in effort to build the greatest naval empire in history. 
}
France_descr {
 France. Since rising to the throne, Louis XIV has actively built up his military presence in the New World. A great colonial power, that considers no interests save its own. 
}
Holland_descr {
 The Netherlands. A young nation, striving towards trade supremacy. An active ally with France against their common enemy Spain. As regards everyone else, the Dutch remain solidly neutral. 
}
Spain_descr {
Spain. A great colonial power, presiding over the largest share of the New World. Under constant pressure from the other two great powers, England and France, who actively strive to enlarge their own share of the New World. 
}
Pirate_descr {
 Pirates - folks who choose not to recognize national differences, who live only by the laws of the Brotherhood of the Coast. Not that this stops them from hanging out and peddling their loot in Port Royal or Tortuga. They may side with any of the powers on a whim, though they are united in one thing - hatred for Escorial. 
 In any case, for any patrol in the colonies, a pirate flag is as good as a red one. A rogue, or a secret agent? Such is the lot of a pirate. 
}
Hunter_hint {
 Your relationship with the empire, by way of its soldiers and citizenry. Deeds for the good of the nation raise one's internal reputation; bad deeds can put a prince on your head. And that means an eternal hunt, across land and sea, since there's no shortage of bounty hunters in the Caribbean. You can lower your bounty, however, by your deeds or by putting money in the right hands. You scratch the Empire's back, it refrains from shooting you in yours. 
}
LevelComplexity {Difficulty}
LevelComplexity_desc {
 The game's difficulty shifts from 'sailor' to 'impossible', through a total of ten grades. 'Captain' is the medium one. Affects the rate of level growth of the characters, money, and much more. 
}
RechargePistolOnLine {Auto reload pistols}
RechargePistolOnLine_desc {
 In this mode, pistols automatically reload during battles. Otherwise, when you're power is dry, all you've got is the sword in your sheath. 
 This mode affects all the residents of the game world.}
HardcoreGame {Hardcore Game}
HardcoreGame_desc {
 Not enough adrenaline in the game? Want to feel like a real corsair, feel the rush of action and consequence? In this mode, you can only save your game on land, in churches. Whatever mistakes you make, you'll have to live with. How much of a man are you, really? 
}
ArcadeSailMode_desc {
 The speed and dynamism of sea battles. Do you prefer fast action and task juggling, or slow tactical contemplation? 
}
EncountersRate_desc {
 The frequency of enemy encounters in the game, particularly as regards ships on the world map. 
}
WorldAlivePause {Charge of the Empires}
WorldAlivePause_desc {
 This mode gives the player a chance to complete one of the quest scenarios for an empire, yet freezes the "live world" - movings of the governor-generals, city invasions by countries, the ability for the hero to keep the city - before the game's end. 
 The living world resumes its function only after the scenario is completed. 
}
Prisoner {Prisoner}
Prisoner_desc {
 A prisoner can be interrogated in the ship's hold, to discern his identity. Then you can ransom him from his empire. 
 The biggest ransoms will be paid by the governors of the same nation as the prisoner, though the price may vary from city to city. 
}
shipChoose_hint {
 Clicking on a companion's ship calls up a friendly trading mode with its crew. Works on land and sea. If you need to trade in battle, you need to steer right up next to the ship. 
}
GoodsCargo_hint {
 A list of the goods in the ship's hold. 
 Double-clicking on an item brings up a description of the item with the option of discarding it. 
}
EXP_SLIDE {Experience rate }
EXP_SLIDE_desc {
 Here you can set the speed of experience gain by the hero and his officers. The higher the speed, the faster that skill points are accumulated - meaning new level and abilities. 
}
