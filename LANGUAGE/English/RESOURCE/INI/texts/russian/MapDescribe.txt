type_full_0 {This is #sMapIslName#. The map marks a secret location #sMaplocName#, where a famous pirate hid his treasure. 
 The authenticity of the map is confirmed by the brown spots of blood that point to the fact that the map has often changed hands.

type_full_1 {
 On this map of #sMapIslName#, you can see a mark showing the treasure location #sMaplocName#. But whether it is there or not, you'll never know unless you look. 
 The map is rather old, and there is no need to doubt its authenticity. 
}
type_full_1_isl {}
type_full_1_mein {}
type_full_2 {
 The map's fresh and the paper has yet to yellow. If you believe the markings, then the treasure's hidden somewhere #sMaplocName#, on the island of #sMapIslName#. Will it be there? Can't hurt to check! 
}

type_part {
 This is one part of a map that clearly leads to treasure. To find its location is impossible, because there's very little information on this piece alone. But one can hope that somewhere lies the second part of this map, and that someday it will land in my hands. 
 And then all will become clear! 
}
type_fake {
 This map purports to lead to treasures. One can always go and look, of course, but this is an obvious fake. 
 It's probably better just to chuck it out.
