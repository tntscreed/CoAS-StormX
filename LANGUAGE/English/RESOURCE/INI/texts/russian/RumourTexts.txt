Attak_GoldFleet_t1 {It's become totally unsafe at sea! The Spanish golden fleet, on its way from Portobelo to Havana, was attacked by pirates! Or maybe English privateers. I don't know, exactly. But what gall! I'd love to see those scoundrels hanged!}
Attak_GoldFleet_t2 {It's getting worse with every day! Now the Spanish golden fleet, which was carting gold, silver, and other bounty of the New World from Portobelo to Havana, was boldly attacked! The world is coming to an end! Oh dear Mary, mother of God!}

DuelHero_t1 {They say that #sName# has sold his soul to the devil - and that's why he's such a demon in battle! They say the souls of those he's killed, and that's, what, #sKill# people already - go straight down to hell. They say if he stops killing the devil will take his soul. Though granted, I'm not sure where they get this information...}
