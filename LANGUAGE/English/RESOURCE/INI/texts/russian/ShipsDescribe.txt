Tartane {
 The tartane is a small fishing vessel with a triangular sail, that first appeared in Mediterranean waters. Soon, the tartane's excellent sailing characteristics made it a very popular ship, used for coastal sailing and trading between close settlements. 
}
WarTartane {
A War Tartane is a large tartane with small cannons on board. It shall never be considered a serious ship, but it is widely used in the whole world for pirate and smuggling raids.
}
Lugger {
 Lugger - a small ship, made for transporting cargo and protecting small convoys. Although the lugger is modestly armed and crewed, it is specially designed for trade and battle. Many captains value the lugger for its speed and maneuverability. The small size prevents its use on long sea journeys. 
}
Sloop {
 With its small hull and great sailing properties, the sloop is a very effective recon ship, good for coastal patrolling and trade. 
}
Barque {
 Barque - a ship made for long journeys. With its roomy cargo hold and formidable firepower, the barque is considered one the best ships in its class. However, the big size does not allow for great speed or maneuverability, so it loses out in sailing to lighter ships in its class. 
}
Schooner {
 The schooner's solid sailing characteristics and a roomy hold have made it one of the most attractive medium-grade trading ships. Perfect for those unable to afford a flute.
}
Caravel {
The distinctive, unusually-shaped decks of the caravel make its profile easy to identify across even the longest distance. Since caravels fare rather poorly in battle, they have generally been consigned to freighter duty. On the plus side, they do carry a lot of cargo. 
}
Fleut {
 Though the flute is big and sturdy enough for long sea journeys, it is unwise to rely on in battle. Still, it is a solid trade ship, as there is little equal to the size of its hold. 
}
Brig {
 Brigs are often used as trade vessels, though more often as warships. High speed and maneuverability make them amongst the most balanced vessels. The weapons do affect maneuverability, however. 
}
Galeon_l {
 The galleon is, without a doubt, the most ship class in history. A close relative to the caravel, the galleon is a clumsy yet dependable vessel, serving sailors for almost two hundred years. Easy prey for a real pirate. 
}
Corvette {
 The corvette was designed as a highly-armed, yet light and fast vessel. Trade-offs being trade-offs, corvettes therefore have a weak hull. Still, they are able to keep up with lighter vessels and trade blows with heavier ones. As a rule, the corvette is used for patrol and escort missions. 
}
Galeon_h {
 The heavy galleon is a massive warship. Large caliber cannons, a solid hull, and a huge crew make it a reliable defense for any cargo. 
}
Pinnace {
 A pinnace is big and sturdy enough for long sea voyage, the hold can carry a decent supply of cargo, and it's armed rather well. All that said, it lacks maneuverability in battle, and is slower than a real war ship. 
}
Frigate {
 The fast and maneuverable frigate is liked by many for its nice sailing properties and its firepower. A squadron of frigates can easily destroy a fort and loot a city. 
}
LineShip {
 A warship, with more cannons than a frigate, will lose out to it in speed and maneuverability - yet because of the reinforced hull and larger frame, some warships can carry even mightiest of cannons.}
Battleship {
 The battleship is a progression of the warship: bigger, and even more well-reinforced. Huge and unwieldy, it carries a few batteries of heavy cannons and is manned by an enormous crew.
}
Warship {
 The ship-of-the-line presents itself as a terrible force. Armed with the mightiest and longest-range cannons to protect its sturdy hull, it can stand up to any ship in the sea and easily destroy shore fortifications. 
}
Manowar {
 The man-o-war is the mightiest vessel born of man. Amongst its three decks it holds a hundred heavy cannons, and its hull is nigh-on impervious to shells. Unfortunately, the huge size and displacement limits its use to big naval battles and fort bombardment. 
}
SoleyRu {
 A royal line ship, first class: horrifying firepower, mixed with a refined hull and inspiring sailing properties. A grand ship for the ages. 
}
NoneBoat {
 No ship. The hero has become a land rat, until he scrapes up a ship for himself can no longer call himself a captain. 
}
Hull {
 Hull - the current and maximum damage that the hull can sustain. 
}
Sails {
 Sails - the current and maximum damage that the sails can sustain. 
}
Speed {
 Speed - shows the ship's current maximum speed, all things considered (cargo, captain's skills, damage to ship, etc.), against the ship's overall maximum. 
}
Maneuver {
 Maneuverability - shows the ship's current maximum speed, all things (cargo, captain's skills, damage to ship) considered, against the ship's overall maximum. 
}
AgainstWind {
 Characteristics, showing the ability of the ship to sail under the minimum angle of wind. The higher the rating, then the closer to the wind the ship sails. Ships with sloped sails are better suited to moving in conflicting winds.
}
Capacity {
 Hold - shows the current and maximum volume in the cargo hold. The less free space there is, the slower and less maneuverable the ship becomes. 
 Any weapons installed also have an effect on cargo area. You can put them off the ship if you need to make more room for cargo. For that, you need to go to the bottom of this interface and double-click on 'Cannons'. 
}
Crew {
 Crew - shows the current tally of seamen, along with the minimum and maximum number allowance, for the selected ship. 
}
CannonType {
 Cannon Type - shows the class (cannon or culverin), caliber, and number of installed cannons 
}
sCannons {
 Shows the maximum caliber and maximum number of cannons that can fit on a ship. 
}
Crew_Exp {Crew experience}
Crew_Exp_hint {
 Crew experience is divided into three categories: sea (affecting a ship's control), cannoneer (affecting the speed of reloading, and accuracy of, cannons), and grappling (the effectiveness of the team in hand to hand combat). 
 A small but experienced crew can be more effective than a shipload of greenhorns. 
 The team gathers experience in all three categories while doing their respective jobs (Maneuverability, Cannons, Grappling), but also experience can be lost if the crew don't get a chance to practice their skills for a long while.}
TakeAllGoods_hint {
 The button 'Transfer cargo' handles shifting the goods onto the character's ship, in relation to its middle price. The most valuable items are loaded first, and then the less expensive ones in turn, until there's no free space in the hold. 
}
GoodsKeys_hint {
 Using the right and left arrow keys on the keyboard, you can shift goods by the bundle. If you press the arrow keys while holding the [Shift] key, you will select the maximum quantities possible. Click the right mouse button on an item to select ten packets at a time.
}
Shipyard_hint {
 You can buy, repair, or sell ships at the shipyard. 
 The hero can't sell his ship if he has companions. You also can't buy a ship for a companion if the hero doesn't have his own ship. 
 To change the hero's or companion's ship, while saving all the cargo in the hold and the crew, you need to go to the list of the ships in the hero's squadron (over on the left of the screen), and pick the ship that will be exchanged for a new one. Then, in the list of ships being sold at the dockyard (over on the right, now), pick the desired one. Finally, go hit the "Buy" button. To buy a new ship (and appoint a companion), you should first buy an empty slot for the list on the left.
